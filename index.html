        <h6>May 2022</h6>
        <p>Hello guys I am back and just want to update you guys on whatever happens in my life. Recently I just attended a online Oathtaking ceremony for the newly Licensed Electronics Technician in the Philippines and I could say that it is not that great of a experience because it doesn't have much of a hype, bc of online. I'm planning to take the Electronics Engineer Licensure Examination on October 2022 and hopefully by then we can have our Face to Face Oathtaking. :)
